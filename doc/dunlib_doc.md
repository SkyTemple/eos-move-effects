# Terminology

### Function Parameters

See "global_doc.md" for more information.

### User and Target

Pointers to a dungeon RAM monster structure (one for the user of the move and one for the target; if the move hits multiple targets the code will be executed for each target).

Most of the time the User is only used to display messages (see Message functions); by convention, always pass the current user of the move as the User.

If you want to apply an effect to the current user, pass the current user as the Target of the effect.

See UsernameFodder's RAM notes about entity data block offsets: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Q_7BGmNx5wJtJ9iJEwlK1WITjiCcEQxE9C82RECJbg/edit


### StatType

The type of stat that will be affected by the function.
- for Attack & Defense functions: 0 = Normal, 1 = Special
- for Focus functions: 0 = Accuracy, 1 = Evasiveness

### MoveData

MoveData is a pointer to an 8 bytes RAM structure composed of the following elements: 
- flags (4 bytes)
- move_id (2 bytes)
- pp_left (1 byte)
- boost (1 byte)

### FailMessage

FailMessage indicates that the function must not send any message to the dungeon console or the console if the effect was prevented.
For example, if this is set to 0 for the Poison function, the game will not send the message saying that the Pecha Scarf prevented poisoning.

### r0: Success = RandomChanceUT(r0: User, r1: Target, r2: Chance)

Chance is a chance between 0 and 100.

Always returns 0 if the User or the Target fainted.

### r0: Success = RandomChanceU(r0: User, r1: Chance)

## Getters

### r0: WeatherID = GetWeather(r0: Target)

Applies target's effects that neutralize weather conditions.

## Messages

### ChangeString(r0: StringID, r1: Target, r2: ???)

Any message with the string manipulator "\[string:StringID\]" will use that string

Note: r2 seems to always be 0 

### SendMessageWithIDCheckULog(r0: User, r1: MessageID)

Checks if the User fainted.

If it hasn't, calls SendMessageWithID with Log set to 1.

### SendMessageWithStringCheckULog(r0: User, r1: StringPointer)

Checks if the User fainted.

If it hasn't, calls SendMessageWithString with Log set to 1.

### SendMessageWithIDNoLog(r0: User, r1: MessageID)

Same as SendMessageWithID but sets Log to 0.

### SendMessageWithStringNoLog(r0: User, r1: StringPointer)

Same as SendMessageWithString but sets Log to 0.

### SendMessageWithIDCheckUTLog(r0: User, r1: Target, r2: MessageID)

Checks something with the User or the Target fainted.

If they haven't, calls SendMessageWithID with Log set to 1.

### SendMessageWithStringCheckUTLog(r0: User, r1: Target, r2: StringPointer)

Checks something with the User or the Target fainted.

If they haven't, calls SendMessageWithString with Log set to 1.

### SendMessageWithIDCheckUTNoLog(r0: User, r1: Target, r2: MessageID)

Checks something with the User or the Target fainted.

If they haven't, calls SendMessageWithID with Log set to 0.

### SendMessageWithIDCheckUULog(r0: User, r1: ???, r2: MessageID)

Checks if the User fainted and something else with an unknown structure.

If the User hasn't fainted, and if the other check passes, calls SendMessageWithID with Log set to 1.

WARNING! Deprecated: function name may change

### SendMessageWithIDLog(r0: User, r1: MessageID)

Same as SendMessageWithID but sets Log to 1.

### SendMessageWithStringLog(r0: User, r1: StringPointer)

Same as SendMessageWithString but sets Log to 1.

### SendMessageWithString(r0: User, r1: StringPointer, r2: Log)

Sends a message to the dungeon console (the one that appears in the lower part 
of the screen) and in the message log.

Use the string pointed at StringPointer.

The User is used to determine if the message is in the same turn as the previous one, in order to separate them with a horizontal bar.

If Log is set to 0, the message will only appear in the message log.

### SendMessageWithID(r0: User, r1: MessageID, r2: Log)

Same as SendMessageWithString, but uses a string defined in the ".str" file at index MessageID.
